A.
This is a GUI version of a hangman game in which a user can input a custom list of words or use a default list of words to play.

B. 
As a player I can guess a letter so that I can see if the letter is in the word or not.
As a player I can choose to run on the command line or a graphic interface so that I can decide whether I want to see the hangman graphically or not.
As a player I can click on the hint button so that I can get a hint from the system if I am stuck.
As a player I decide to use a list of my own words so that I can play this game with new possible words.

C.
The software runs pretty well. The software provides a set number of letters creating a word that the user is trying to guess. The user is supposed to guess one letter at a time and see if the letter is in the word. If the user guesses wrong, the software will start to draw one body part of a hang man at a time. Once he is completely drawn, the user loses game. There is also a counter of the win/loss ratio and a system that records points. There are also hints that the user can use at anytime throughout the game. The system also provides the user with insturctions and a set of options.

hint needs work
