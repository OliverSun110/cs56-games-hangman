A.
This is a GUI version of a hangman game in which a user can input a custom list of words or use a default list of words to play.

B. 
As a player I can guess a letter so that I can see if the letter is in the word or not.
As a player I can choose to run on the command line or a graphic interface so that I can decide whether I want to see the hangman graphically or not.
As a player I can click on the hint button so that I can get a hint from the system if I am stuck.
As a player I decide to use a list of my own words so that I can play this game with new possible words.

C.
The software runs pretty well. The software provides a set number of letters creating a word that the user is trying to guess. The user is supposed to guess one letter at a time and see if the letter is in the word. If the user guesses wrong, the software will start to draw one body part of a hang man at a time. Once it is completely drawn, the user loses game, but if the user can guess all the letters correctly before the whole hang man is drawn, than the user wins. There is also a counter of the win/loss ratio and a system that records points. There are also hints that the user can use at anytime throughout the game. The system also provides the user with insturctions and a set of options.

D.
As a player I can click on the hint button so that I can get a hint that will definitely help me if I am stuck.
As a player I can select a specific color for the background so that I can choose what color I want the background to be.
As a player I can choose to turn off the sound of the game so that I can listen to music while playing this game.
