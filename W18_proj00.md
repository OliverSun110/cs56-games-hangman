Description of the project: Game of guessing letters in a word within 6 times.
### b
1. As a user I can get a hint so that when I could not find any clue of the word the program could give me an instruction.
2. As a user I can change color of the UI so that when I get board of the color of the UI I could change it.
3. As a user I can choose multiplayers mode so that when I want to play with someone else.
### c
Yes it works.
It is a game for user to guess letters in a word. If the letter they guess is correct the program will fill in the letter. If they did not get the correct answer the program will draw one part of the hangingman, and if the program finished drawing the hangingman the user loss.
### d
1. As a player I could select the level of difficulties so that I could try different level of hardness.
2. As a player I could select the kind of word sets I want to play on so that different people who do well in different fields could select different word set to play.
### e
1. We can add more details in the instructions like "You can push the hint button when you could not find a clue."
2. We can add some pictures of the game.
### f
As far as the knowledge I had, I  think the build.xml is good, but we probably will turn it into Gradle or Maven.
