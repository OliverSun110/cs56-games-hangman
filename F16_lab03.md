A) Our project is a hangman game which uses both Command-line style and Graphical Interface. It uses a custom or default word list and the user guesses letter by letter
B) As a user I can type in letters in to the GUI window and guess letters in the word. I can also ask for a hint and it gives me one of the letters.
C) Yes the software runs and just has a few bugs that are listed in issue. You guess letters and try to fill up the word.
D) The hint button could automatically guess that letter for you instead of you having to guess it. The simple hangman man could also be made more visually appealing
E) Although basic instructions on how to start the game are in there, details about other aspects of the game such as points and hints could be added in.
F) The build file looks pretty complete but one of the issues is to clean it up so that can be looked in to.
G)There are enough points in all the issues to get a 1000 points however most of the issue are low point amounts (50 points) so we would have to complete almost all of the issues. The issues are fairly simple are very clear.\
H)https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-hangman/issues/56
I)Most of the code is well written and clearly commented however the code for the gui is a bit disorganized and lacks comments and the comments that were written are not very descriptive. The names of the classes and methods are very descriptive of there fucntion and for the most part it is clear what the function do. The code in hangmangui.java is a bit disorganized and it does look like "one screenful of text" and it is hard to understand quickly what is being done.
J) The test coverage is not great. There are only two tests that simple go through the process of geasting all the character in the hangman game; one guess all right, one guesses all wrong. The test coverage need to be greatly expanded to cover the possiblilties for not only the input for the hangman guess but also testing the buttons and other elements to see if they are functioning properly.
